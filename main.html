            <div class="heading">Flood</div>
            <p>Flooding is a temporary overflow of water onto land that is normally dry. Floods are the most common disaster in the United States. Failing to evacuate flooded areas or entering flood waters can lead to injury or death.
                 <br>
                 <span class="h-4">Floods may:</span><br>

                Make a plan today. Your family may not be together if a disaster strikes, so it is important to know which types of disasters could affect your area. Know how you’ll contact one another and reconnect if separated. Establish a family meeting place that’s familiar and easy to find<br>
                <span class="h-3"> Step 1: Put a plan together by discussing the questions below with your family, friends or household to start your emergency plan.</span><br>
               1. How will I receive emergency alerts and warnings?<br>
2.What is my shelter plan?<br>
3.What is my evacuation route?<br>
4.What is my family/household communication plan?<br>
5.Do I need to update my emergency preparedness kit?<br>
                <span class="h-3">Step 2:  Consider specific needs in your household.</span><br>
                As you prepare your plan tailor your plans and supplies to your specific daily living needs and responsibilities. Discuss your needs and responsibilities and how people in the network can assist each other with communication, care of children, business, pets or specific needs like operating medical equipment. Create your own personal network for specific areas where you need assistance. Keep in mind some these factors when developing your plan:<br>

            <p>
                After an emergency, you may need to survive on your own for several days. Being prepared means having your own food, water and other supplies to last for several days. A disaster supplies kit is a collection of basic items your household may need in the event of an emergency.<br>
                <span class="h-4"> Basic Disaster Supplies Kit</span><br>
To assemble your kit store items in airtight plastic bags and put your entire disaster supplies kit in one or two easy-to-carry containers such as plastic bins or a duffel bag.<br>

A basic emergency supply kit could include the following recommended items:<br>

1.Water (one gallon per person per day for several days, for drinking and sanitation)<br>
2.Food (at least a several-day supply of non-perishable food)<br>
3.Battery-powered or hand crank radio and a NOAA Weather Radio with tone alert<br>
4.Flashlight<br>
5.First aid kit<br>
6.Extra batteries<br>
7.Whistle (to signal for help)<br>
8.Dust mask (to help filter contaminated air)<br>
9.Plastic sheeting, scissors and duct tape (to shelter in place)<br>
10.Moist towelettes, garbage bags and plastic ties (for personal sanitation)<br>
11.Wrench or pliers (to turn off utilities)<br>
12.Manual can opener (for food)<br>
13.Local maps<br>
14.Cell phone with chargers and a backup battery<br>

                We have all heard that knowledge is power. In an emergency, it can be lifesaving. This is why we are encouraging everyone to “Be in the Know” to evacuate safely.<br>
                <br>
                <span class="h-3">Know Your Risks</span><br>
1.It’s important to understand your location’s risks because no two communities face the same extreme weather conditions. You can find your local risks with FEMA’s National Risk Index.<br>
<span class="h-3">Know When and Where to Go</span><br>
1.Whether it's the home of a friend or family member or a pre-designated shelter, know your evacuation destination.<br>
2.Having these plans in place can save valuable time and, most importantly, lives.<br>
3.Many states have designated evacuation zones and predetermined evacuation routes. Learn your state and local plans by visiting your state and county emergency management websites.<br>
<span class="h-3">Know What to Bring</span><br>
1.Build a go-bag with all the essentials you might need, so you don’t need to scramble in an evacuation situation. Find a list of supplies at Build A Kit.<br>
2.Make sure everyone in your household knows where the bag is stored, and who is responsible for it in the event of an emergency. <br>
<span class="h-3">Know Your Information Sources</span><br>
1.Identify where you can access reliable information so you can make informed decisions before, during, and after a disaster. Keeping up to date with the latest developments can save lives.<br>
2.Sign up for alerts from your local emergency management agencies and the National Weather Service, which will provide updates on threat conditions, shelter locations, and other important safety information.<br>
3.Download the FEMA App where you can receive real-time weather alerts, locate emergency shelters in your area, prepare for common hazards, and more.<br>

            <div class="heading">Fire Escape</div>
            <p>
               Creating and practicing a home fire escape plan is simple. Follow the steps below to make sure everyone in your home is prepared and knows what to do in case of a home fire.<br>

1.Make a written home fire escape plan and practice getting out in under 2 minutes.<br>
2.Make sure you have smoke alarms on every level of your home and in each bedroom. Test them twice a year.<br>
3.Learn the best practices for home fire safety and fire safety with children.<br>
<span class="h-3">Make an Escape Plan</span><br>
1.Learn two ways out of every room in your home, in case one exit is blocked or dangerous to use. A second way out can include an escape ladder for rooms on an upper level.<br>
2.Practice getting low and moving to your exits in case there is smoke.<br>
3.Choose a safe meeting place a safe distance from your home. <br>
4.Have a home fire drill at least twice a year.<br>
<span class="h-3">Children and Fire Safety</span><br>
It is important to have a plan when there are children in your home. Children may become very scared and need clear direction and help getting out of the house. They may not know how to escape or what to do unless an adult shows them.<br>
1.Have a plan for young children under six who cannot get outside by themselves. In your plan, talk about who will help each child get out safely.<br>
2.Children should know what to do when they hear a smoke alarm and there is no adult around. Help them practice going to the outside meeting place.<br>
3.Teach children to NEVER go back inside a burning building. Once they are out, stay out!<br>
4.Teach your child to get low and crawl on the ground, where the air is less smoky.<br>
5.Show a child how to use the back of their hand to check doors for heat before opening and to use a different way out if the door is hot.<br> 
6.If your child needs to use an escape ladder, show them where you keep it and practice how to use it.<br>
